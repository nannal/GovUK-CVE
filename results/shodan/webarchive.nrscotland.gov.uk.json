The Legislative Assembly officially created Great Salt Lake County on January 31, 1850. Over 11,000 residents lived in the County at that time. The first formal meeting of Salt Lake County government occurred on March 15, 1852, eighteen months after the Utah Territory was established by the United States Congress. Probate judges and county selectmen functioned in what was known as the County Court. The duties of the County Court included both judicial and executive powers for the administration of county government.\n \nWith statehood in 1896, a county commission was created. At this time, County government had a County Auditor, Assessor, Attorney, Clerk, Recorder, Sheriff, Surveyor, and Treasurer \u2013 the same independent offices that exist today. In 2000, a new Mayor/Council form of government was chosen by the voters to replace the County Commission.  Today, County government serves over 1 million residents.  \n</p>\n\n\n</span></div></div><div style=\"visibility:\" class=\"item\" id=\"featured-item-63\"><a class=\"item_link\" href=\"/organizations/1223\"><div class=\"entity-logo\"><img alt=\"University of Nebraska-Lincoln \" src=\"/image/featured-organizations/1223/tn\" class=\"tn\"/></div><div><span class=\"item_title\">University of Nebraska-Lincoln </span></div></a><div class=\"description\"><span class=\"ellipsis_text\"><p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries web archives program is dedicated to collecting, preserving, and providing access to archived websites to document the University's records, activities, and accomplishments.</p>\n</span></div></div><div style=\"visibility:\" class=\"item\" id=\"featured-item-63\"><a class=\"item_link\" href=\"/organizations/1167\"><div class=\"entity-logo\"><img alt=\"Harvard Kennedy School of Government\" src=\"/image/featured-organizations/1167/tn\" class=\"tn\"/></div><div><span class=\"item_title\">Harvard Kennedy School of Government</span></div></a><div class=\"description\"><span class=\"ellipsis_text\"><p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nHarvard Kennedy School maintains an abiding commitment to advancing the public interest by training skilled, enlightened leaders and solving public problems through world-class scholarship and active engagement with practitioners and decision makers.

The Whitney is dedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting, and exhibiting American art, and its collection--arguably the finest holding of twentieth-century American art in the world--is the Museum's key resource. The Museum's signature exhibition, the Biennial, is the country's leading survey of the most recent developments in American art.\r\n</p>\n\r\n<p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nInnovation has been a hallmark of the Whitney since its beginnings. It was the first museum dedicated to the work of living American artists and the first New York museum to present a major exhibition of a video artist (Nam June Paik in 1982). Such figures as Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly, and Cindy Sherman were given their first museum retrospectives by the Whitney. The Museum has consistently purchased works within the year they were created, often well before the artists became broadly recognized. The Whitney was the first museum to take its exhibitions and programming beyond its walls by establishing corporate-funded branch facilities, and the first museum to undertake a program of collection-sharing (with the San Jose Museum of Art) in order to increase access to its renowned collection.\r\n</p>\n\r\n<p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nDesigned by architect Renzo Piano and situated between the High Line and the Hudson River, the Whitney's new building vastly increases the Museum\u2019s exhibition and programming space, providing the first comprehensive view of its unsurpassed collection of modern and contemporary American art.</p>\n</span></div></div><div style=\"visibility:\" class=\"item\" id=\"featured-item-192\"><a class=\"item_link\" href=\"/organizations/304\"><div class=\"entity-logo\"><img alt=\"Columbia University Libraries\" src=\"/image/featured-organizations/304/tn\" class=\"tn\"/></div><div><span class=\"item_title\">Columbia University Libraries</span></div></a><div class=\"description\"><span class=\"ellipsis_text\"><p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nThe Columbia University Libraries (CUL) web resources collection program \narchives selected websites in thematic areas corresponding to \nexisting CUL collection strengths, websites produced by affiliates of \nColumbia University, and websites from organizations or individuals \nwhose papers or records are held in CUL's physical archives.</p>\n</span></div></div><div style=\"visibility:\" class=\"item\" id=\"featured-item-192\"><a class=\"item_link\" href=\"/organizations/735\"><div class=\"entity-logo\"><img alt=\"University of Miami\" src=\"/image/featured-organizations/735/tn\" class=\"tn\"/></div><div><span class=\"item_title\">University of Miami</span></div></a><div class=\"description\"><span class=\"ellipsis_text\"><p class=\"seamTextPara\">\nThe University of Miami Libraries collects and preserves materials covering a broad range of subject areas in support of teaching, learning, and research.
