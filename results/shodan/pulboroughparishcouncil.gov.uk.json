The sessions are not being held until the autumn; however appointments are filling up quickly, so residents need to get in touch if they would like an appointment.<p>\r\n</p>Every year, nationally, there are around 1,000 fires caused by unsafe electric blankets and sadly, some people lose their lives. Blankets that are over ten years old are a particular concern because they don't have the same overheat protection found in newer blankets. Firefighters have recommended that anyone with an electric blanket over ten years old replaces it. Many elderly and vulnerable people can benefit from these free testing sessions, which could save their lives.<p></p> The Fire and Rescue Service will be running 12 electric blanket testing events at venues across West Sussex from Tuesday 4 October 2016 until Thursday 27 October 2016. The free safety tests are carried out by fire service personnel who have been specially trained to use the testing equipment. The testing will be carried out by appointment only and will run from 10am to 4pm each day. Residents can call 0845 872 9719 to book their appointment.

We know that as a district we are fortunate to have local communities who generally take pride in the appearance of their locality \r\nbut for those who want to go the extra mile and take more care of a particular area, this scheme is ideal. It is commendable that we have recruited so many of the district\ufffds residents \r\nwho are willing to volunteer to litter pick on a regular basis, it sets a sound example to the community.\ufffd<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTo support volunteers, the council provides health and safety training, advice to co-ordinate volunteers and equipment in the form of litter pickers, plastic bags, protective gloves  and \r\nbranded hi-viz jackets.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf you would like to make a difference in your area or get a group of volunteers together, please email Horsham District Council at hopoast@horsham.gov.uk or alternatively, \r\ncall the Adopt-a-Street Co-ordinator Karen Grisley for a chat about how you would like to help on 01403 739387 or 07989 442 376.\r\n</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>28/01/15 Launch of Facebook page</STRONG><BR/>Pulborough Parish Council now has a Facebook page to keep you informed of what is going on at the Parish Council.\r\n     Please use the link on the home page and &quot;like&quot; our page.</P>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t</DIV>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!-- END OF CONTENT -->\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   <!-- FOOTER --><div id=\"footer\">\r\n <p>\r\n  &copy; Pulborough Parish Council 2000-2016.
