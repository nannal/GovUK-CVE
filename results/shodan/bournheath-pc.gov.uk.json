Years after producing watches for their usual target audience of children, LEGO have decided to hit the adult market and appeal to those who are still kids at heart.</p>\n<p>Even though the watches are styled and sized for adults, we understand the watches will have interchangeable parts such as swappable bezels and bracelet links, all adding to the fun. The \u2018LEGO Watch System\u2019, as the collection will be officially known, will hit the market in November 2013.</p>\n<p>From unofficial leaks of the pre-production watches, we have an idea that the watch cases will be about 40mm wide and made of plastic, with some being partially aluminium or steel. There will also be an impressive variety of colours and shapes on offer, ranging from \u201csilly to rather sensible\u201d, with the ability to arrange bracelet links to customise the style of your own watch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.watchhub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lego-Watch-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-341 alignleft\" alt=\"Lego Watch 2\" src=\"http://blog.watchhub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lego-Watch-2.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The LEGO watches are bound to have a nostalgic feel for many people who grew up playing with the famous building blocks as children; but the timepieces are set to be extremely practical and not just a gimmick.</p>\n<p>We understand the watches will be priced between \u00a370 to \u00a3150.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"cat-links\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"entry-utility-prep

Ermine Street was the main Roman road from London to Lincoln and on to York. Edmonton appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is recorded as Adelmetone- 'a farmstead or estate of a man called \u0112adhelm' from an Old English personal name and <i>t\u016bn</i>.<sup>[3]</sup></span></div><div><span class=\"cf2\">Edmonton Hundred was a division of the historic county of Middlesex from Saxon times, an area of some 31,000 acres (125 km<sup>2</sup>) stretching up the west bank of the Lea from Tottenham to the county boundary south of Waltham Cross, and west into what is now Hertfordshire as far as South Mimms. Local government in the modern sense began in 1837 with the Edmonton Union, set up under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. This also covered a wide district of 47,102 acres (191 km<sup>2</sup>), including the modern boroughs of Haringey and Enfield, plus Cheshunt, Waltham Abbey and Waltham Cross. The town hall was built in 1884<sup>[4]</sup> and extended in 1903.<sup>[5]</sup></span></div><div><span class=\"cf2\">The population of this area grew rapidly, reaching 445,875 by 1911 and would today be about 615,000. As the population mushroomed Middlesex was subdivided into many small local government areas, a much smaller Edmonton of 3,894 acres (16 km<sup>2</sup>) eventually achieving the status of borough (main article Municipal Borough of Edmonton) in 1937. At the 1961 census the borough had a population of 91,956.<sup>[6]</sup> This was absorbed into the London Borough of Enfield in 1965, and the former town hall and civic buildings were controversially demolished by Enfield Council in 1989.<sup>[7]</sup></span></div><div><span class=\"cf2\">Pymmes Park with its historic walled garden is Upper Edmonton's park. Pymmes Park originated as a private estate. In the late 16th century it was owned by the powerful Cecil family. In 1589 Robert Cecil, later 1st Earl of Salisbury, spent his honeymoon at Pymmes. Cecil was a protege of Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth I's chief spymaster and he succeeded him as Secretary of State in 1590. The estate was eventually acquired by Edmonton Council and opened as a public park in 1906. Pymmes House was destroyed by fire during the Second World War and the remains were demolished.</span></div><div><span class=\"cf2\">In the 17th century the then rural Edmonton had a reputation for supernatural activities. In approximately 1600, a play entitled <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i> was performed in London about a wizard who lived there. In 1621 the villagers accused an old woman, Elizabeth Sawyer, of witchcraft and she was subsequently executed at Tyburn; her story was told in a pamphlet by Henry Goodcole, and in a 1621 play entitled <i>The Witch of Edmonton</i>.</span></div><div><span class=\"cf2\">The historic All Saints' Church is situated in Church Street as is Lamb's Cottage, which was home to writers Charles Lamb and Mary Lamb.</span></div><div><span class=\"cf2\">John Keats, the poet, was apprenticed to surgeon Dr. Hammond in Church Street between 1810-1816. The house was demolished in 1931 to be replaced by Keats Parade. An extant shop carries a blue plaque in commemoration.<sup>[8]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><sup class=\"cf2\"><br></sup></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Geography<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Wood Green stretches from Turnpike Lane in the south to the borough boundary in the north.<sup>[3]</sup> It's eastern and western boundaries have changed over time and today people have varying senses of what exactly is included in Wood Green. One definition sees the western boundary as formed by the Great Northern Railway Line. Others argue that Alexandra Park is still within Wood Green's boundaries. Less contentious is the eastern boundary. A common definition would roughly describe it by a line running from the south western corner of Tottenhall Park, to the junction of The Roundway and Lordship Lane, then along Downhills Way as far as Belmont Avenue. This part of the boundary is completed by a line running in a northwesterly direction as far as Westbury Avenue. <sup>[4]</sup><sup>[<i>dubious \u2013 discuss</i>]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The area is rises from 66 ft (20m) to 98 ft (30m) above sea level.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Locale<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The shopping area and residential areas of Wood Green offer quite different identities. Although it was developed as a mainly middle class residential area, today the high street and the shopping mallhost mainly low-priced shops, giving a somewhat down-at-heel air. However, behind the high street, Wood Green's streets include a high proportion of attractive high quality Victorian houses. To the north and west of the tube station, a large number of green spaces weave through the streets and a number of larger open green areas remain.<sup>[5]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Toponymy<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The name Wood Green derives from \u2018Woodlegh\u2019 or 'Woodlea', a Saxon word meaning open ground near a wood, which in this case relates to an opening in Tottenham Wood, an extensive area of woodland which formerly covered most of this area and westward to Muswell Hill.<sup>[6]</sup>. The earliest surviving written record of \u2018Woodlegh\u2019 is a reference in documentation dating from 1256, which relates to a grant for Ducketts Manor, (a sub-manor of Tottenham) which used to be located just to the east of the present-day Wood Green High Road, roughly opposite the junction of Alexandra Road and the High Road.<sup>[7]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">History<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Records suggest that settlement around Wood Green did not start till after the Norman Conquest.<sup>[7]</sup> There is some limited evidence of Roman presence in the Wood Green area but none of any Saxonsettlement. However, from the latter part of the 14th century a number of estates developed around Wood Green. This included the Manor of Ducketts and a handful of smaller estates.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">In the early Seventeenth Century, the lord of Tottenham Manor, the Earl of Dorset, conducted a major survey of his land. It showed that Wood Green, at the time roughly the Western half of Tottenham, had only sixteen houses and 50 inhabitants.<sup>[7]</sup><sup>[8]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\"><span class=\"ff1\">\u201cRound House\u201d or \u201cMushroom House\u201d. Built in 1822 as the gatehouse for Chitts Hill House, this building still stands at the edge of Woodside Park in Wood Green. It is Grade II listed.</span><sup><span class=\"fssmaller ff1\">[9]</span></sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">At around the same time as the Dorset Survey, the New River was constructed through Wood Green. Winding through the area, the river looped across Chitts Hill and then passed along the northern side of Wood Green Common before turning south. The proximity of Wood Green to the new water course enhanced the area\u2019s reputation and between the 17th and early 19th Century several large properties were constructed in the area, initially as country retreats for wealthy Londoners. Such dwellings included Cherson House, Wood Green Cottage, Moat Cottage and the Grange, all of which were situated on the fringes of Wood Green Common and dated from the 17th Century. Later, Wood Green House (c. 1780), Chitts Hill House (c. 1805) and Bounds Green House were constructed at the perimeter of the common. Despite the development of these dwellings, by 1798 the population of Wood Green stood at just 100 inhabitants and remained scattered. It was centred at this period on Wood Green Common.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2 ff1\">Notice for 1806 sale of land in Wood Green (Exact location unknown).</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">At the same time as the population was growing so was the traffic along Green Lanes. As a result Wood Green's first inn and recognisable business appeared. In 1770 George Chesser established a blacksmith's shop on the corner of Green Lanes and Lordship Lane (later known as Spouter's Corner). In 1781, the Three Jolly Butchers coaching inn was opened on the west side of Green Lanes between Lordship Lane and Bounds Green Road.<sup>[7]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">During the early decades of the 19th Century the number of inhabitants in the area began to increase significantly. By the middle of the nineteenth century the population had increased to 400<sup>[7]</sup> and the centre of Wood Green's gravity had moved north and east with most development taking place in a triangle directly north of St Michael's Church.<sup>[10]</sup> By the time of the publication of the 1869 Ordnance Survey map, Clarence Road, Truro Road, Nightingale Road, Finsbury Road and Commerce Road were all laid out and were becoming increasingly built up.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The opening of the Great Northern Railway Line station at Wood Green in 1859 encouraged further development. By the end of the nineteenth century, much of Wood Green had been built up. What remained was built over during the first part of the twentieth century.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">As Wood Green's population grew, so did its high street. The earliest retail developments had been in Commercial Road and Finsbury Road during the 1860s. However by the early 1880's retail activity was clearly shifting to the High Road. At first it focussed on the area between White Hart Lane and Truro Road. As the population grew, retail growth south of Lordship Lane began to exceed that north of it and by the end of the first decade of the twentieth Wood Green High Street had become a popular shopping centre for North London. By 1976 Wood Green was the largest shopping centre in north London with a turnover of more that \u00a320m.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">With the reorganisation of local government in the 1960s, Haringey Council was formed from the former boroughs of Wood Green, Hornsey and Tottenham. The new unified administration wanted to reinvent Wood Green as a \u2018Heart for Haringey\u2019. It was one of a number of new suburban centres intended to counteract the pull of Central London. The Shopping City was constructed between 1976 and 1981.<sup>[11]</sup> With its mall and retail developments above, it was, and remains, a gargantuan development.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Governance history<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Up to the nineteenth century, Wood Green came under the governance of the Manor and Parish of Tottenham. Tottenham developed from a parish in Middlesex into an Urban sanitary district in 1875, after a local board of health had been established in 1850.<sup>[12]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">In 1888, the Municipal Borough of Wood Green was created as an urban district, and later a municipal borough, of Middlesex. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the Municipal Borough of Wood Green was abolished and its area merged with that of the Municipal Borough of Tottenham and the Municipal Borough of Hornsey to form the present-day London Borough of Haringey.<sup>[7]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The constituency of Wood Green was created in 1918 and existed until 1983 when it was split. Some of the constituency was transferred to the neighbouring seat of Tottenham, but most was merged with the Hornsey parliamentary constituency to form the Hornsey and Wood Green parliamentary constituency. Since 2015, the seat has been represented in the House of Commons by the Labour Party MP, Catherine West.<sup>[7]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Other Threads of Wood Green History<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Entertainment history<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The Alexandra Palace, which is within Wood Green parish, played a leading role in the development of public service television.

The <i>feld</i> would have been a reference to an area cleared of trees within woodland that would later become known as Enfield Chase.<sup>[2]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Historical<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Enfield Town used to be a small market town in the county of Middlesex, on the edge of the forest, about a day's walk north of London. As London grew, Enfield Town and its surrounds eventually became a residential suburb, with fast transport links into central London.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The current borough was created in 1965 from the former areas of the Municipal Borough of Southgate, the Municipal Borough of Enfield and the Municipal Borough of Edmonton. The armorial bearings of these three boroughs were also merged. The heraldic beast on the shield of the Enfield coat of arms is known in heraldry as an \"Enfield\" (or colloquially as the Enfield beast), and is used extensively as a logo representing Enfield, particularly by the borough council.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">In Roman times, Enfield was connected to Londinium by Ermine Street, the great Roman road which stretched all the way up to York. Artefacts found in the early 1900s reveal that there were Roman settlements in the areas that are now Edmonton and Bush Hill Park.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">In 790 King Offa of Mercia was recorded as giving the lands of Edmonton to St Albans Abbey. The area became strategically important as East Angliawas taken over by the Danes. In the 790s strongholds were built by men loyal to King Alfred the Great, in order to keep the Danes to the east of the River Lea.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">After the Norman Conquest, both Enfield and Edmonton were mentioned in Domesday Book. Both had churches, and Enfield had 400 inhabitants, Edmonton 300. Enfield is also described as having a \"parc\". This parc\u2014a heavily forested area for hunting\u2014was key to Enfield's existence in the Middle Ages (see Enfield Old Park). Wealthy Londoners came to Enfield first to hunt, and then to build houses in the green, wooded surroundings. In 1303, Edward I of England granted Enfield a charter to hold a weekly market, which has continued up to this day. The old market cross was removed in the early 20th century to make way for a monument to the coronation of King Edward VII, but was preserved by the horticulturalist E. A. Bowles for his garden at nearby Myddelton House, where it remains today.<sup>[3]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Enfield Grammar School with its Tudor Old Hall stands next to the Enfield Town Market Place and St. Andrew's Church, the school having been extended several times since 1586.

Edward was taken there to join her, so that in the company of his sister, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford could break the news to Edward, formally announcing the death of their royal father in the presence chamber at Enfield, on his knees to make formal obeisance to the boy as King.<sup>[5]</sup> Later Elizabeth held court there when she was queen (this was remembered in the name Palace Gardens that was a street running behind Pearsons department store and is still recalled in the name of Enfield's shopping centre).<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Industry<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Enfield has a history of armaments manufacture\u2014see Royal Small Arms Factory.

The Sony Distribution Centre in the Innova Business Park, near Waltham Cross, was burnt to the ground.

Winchmore Hill is 8.9 miles (14.3 km) north north-east of Charing Cross.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Once a small hamlet in the parish of Edmonton, Winchmore Hill now borders Palmers Green, Southgate, Edmonton, and Grange Park.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Prior to the Roman invasion, Hertfordshire, Essex and Middlesex were occupied by the Catuvellauni tribe. It is believed that this tribe built a hill fort on the mound now occupied by Bush Hill Park Golf Club.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The earliest recorded mention of Winchmore Hill is in a deed dated A.D. 1319 in which it is spelt Wynsemerhull. In Old English, 'merhull' translates according to the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names</i> as 'boundary hill'. It might be speculated that the overall title could mean 'Wynsige's boundary hill'. By 1395 the name had been altered to Wynsmerhull and by 1565 the village was known as Wynsmorehyll, becoming Winchmore Hill by the time it was mentioned in state papers in 1586.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">There are many buildings of historical note in Winchmore Hill. The first religious building recorded is the Quaker Meeting House, 1688, rebuilt in 1790. Among those buried here are Luke Howard, the father of modern meteorology, Alice Hum, founder of Palmers Green High School for Girls, and members of the Hoare and Barclay banking families. Samuel Hoare played a prominent role in the campaign against the slave trade.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">St Paul's Church was built as a Waterloo church on land donated from the Grovelands estate. The church ceiling was said to be the largest unsupported expanse of plasterwork in Europe until its renovation in the 1960s introduced concealed supports. The original wooden clapboard St Paul's School building can be seen a little further down Church Hill. The remains of the second, brick-and-stone school building are evident in the walls of the church car park. The current 1960s building is on Ringwood Way, off Station Road. Other historical buildings may be seen on Wades Hill, leading north from The Green. On the right, just beyond the shops, are some wooden clapboard cottages; beyond these on the left is a tall five-storey residential building dating back to 1710. This is in the style of the Georgian town houses of London's West End, but stands alone. It once had a partner house to its right, which was demolished by its owners, Keble School (in the days before such buildings were 'listed').</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The oldest pub in the district was probably the Green Dragon \u2013 on Green Lanes. It is reputed to have opened in 1726 on the junction of Green Lanes and Green Dragon Lane. The Victoria County Historyreveals that by 1752 The Green Dragon was established, although not in its present form. At that time, highwaymen were hanged near to where they were caught, and it is said that one was caught and executed on a gallows erected by the Green Dragon's front entrance. These gallows were not pulled down for a number of years, which might have prompted the owner to move the pub to its current location at the bottom of Vicars Moor Lane near the end of the eighteenth century. The original Green Dragon was pulled down in 1892 and the new one was extensively remodelled in 1935. It was closed as a public house in 2015 although the building remains as a supermarket. In 2017, a micropub called the Little Green Dragon was opened near to the site of the original eighteenth century Green Dragon at the end of Green Dragon Lane.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The Woodman pub near the end of Broadwalk is reported to have been built in 1727, although there is also evidence to suggest that it dates from 1820. Before the building obtained a pub licence in 1868, it was a private residence.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Woodside House and Rowantree House on The Green at the end of Broadwalk were built in 1750 and of painted brick.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Numerous local buildings that were constructed between 1770 and 1839 remain today. Near the Dog and Duck on Hoppers Road are some old terraced houses built around 1770. Number 106A Vicars Moor Lane is a distinctive private residence that retains the fa\u00e7ade of a chapel. To the east on the same road are a number of residences that were probably built around the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2 ff1\">The station c.1875.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">In 1865 the Great Northern Railway obtained permission to build a new line to run from Wood Green to Hertford through Palmers Green and Enfield. However, in 1869 financial constraints forced the company to consider Enfield as the northern terminus. Palmers Green and Winchmore Hill were to be the intervening rural stations. The intention was to finish the line to Enfield by 1870, but the terrain was more troublesome than expected and five men met their death while laying the track. The branch opened on All-Fools Day in 1871 and the first passenger train came through Winchmore Hill, creating a new suburb of London. At first only 16 trains a day left Enfield, mostly for Moorgate.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">An electric tramway along Green Lanes from Palmers Green was developed in 1907, helping to further develop the area. The tramway is now long gone, but the wide road remains and the 329 bus (formerly the 29, and before that the 123) follows the tram route from Enfield to Turnpike Lane.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The Capitol Cinema, designed in the Art Deco style by Robert Cromie, was opened on 29 December 1929 in Green Lanes, on a site now occupied by the office block Capitol House. Briefly run by Lou Morris, the cinema was taken over in December 1930 by ABC Cinemas, which ran it until its closure on 5 December 1959. It was demolished the following year.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Winchmore Hill today<span class=\"ff1\">[</span><span class=\"ff1\">edit</span><span class=\"ff1\">]</span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">At the heart of the area is Winchmore Hill Green, a village green surrounded by shops and restaurants.

Of particular note in Winchmore Hill is Grovelands Park, which was originally a private estate before being partly sold off to the council in 1913.

Its population was very small, and there were no more than a few isolated houses in the mid-17th century. Local records mention a Palmers Field in 1204 and a Palmers Grove in 1340. Palmers Green is mentioned as a highway in 1324 (in Westminster Abbey Muniments).</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">By 1801 the area had grown to a village of 54 buildings, including two inns (according to the Middlesex Record Office). In 1871 the railway line from Wood Green to Enfield was opened and a station was built in Aldermans Hill to serve Palmers Green (half a mile away from the nearest houses).</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The area remained largely undeveloped for thirty more years, as local landowners refused to sell their large estates for building. In 1902, however, large tracts of land were sold for building and the area began to develop rapidly. The first large-scale developments were on the Old Park estate between Fox Lane and Aldermans Hill, and the Hazelwood Park Estate between Hazelwood Lane and Hedge Lane. Within the latter development the building that now serves as Hazelwood Infant School and Hazelwood Junior School was built in Hazelwood Lane in 1908.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">Notable local buildings include Broomfield House and Truro House. The former Southgate Town Hall is now the library and flats. The former Pilgrims Rest (reflecting the name Palmers - \"medieval pilgrim who carried a palm branch as a token of having visited the Holy Land\") has already been demolished for housing. The Fox public house, which has been in its present guise since 1904, was once the site of the Electric Mouse comedy venue.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: start;\"><span class=\"cf2\">The poet and novelist Stevie Smith lived in Palmers Green from 1905 until her death in 1971. That same year Joe Strummer shared a flat at 18 Ash Grove with Tymon Dogg and several others. Paul Scott, the author of <i>The Jewel in the Crown</i>, was born in Palmers Green on 25 March 1920. Victoria Cross recipient Alfred Herring lived locally.

Among the actors who performed there were Richard Attenborough, Vivien Leigh, Roger Moore and (in a mime production) David Bowie. It is no longer a repertory theatre and the building is no longer used exclusively for theatrical performances, but it is still often referred to as the Intimate Theatre.
